    pyalternativeenergy=These are the tips specific to Pyanodon's Alternative Energy. Tips specific to certain techs will appear as you research them.
    blimp=Place down at least two [entity=aerial-base] somewhat far away from each other, and then make an [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01]. You can give the aerial turbine a path between the discharging bases just like you would with trains - select 'store energy' in the menu.\n\nIt will then follow this path. While flying, it will gather wind energy from the air, and when it reaches a base, it will discharge this energy. The bases have a large energy buffer to average out the energy gain over time. You can click on the aerial turbines to see their accumulated energy.
    lfr-stirling=[entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and [entity=stirling-concentrator] both use sunlight to warm up [fluid=molten-salt] during the day. The higher-temperature molten salt can then be used to generate electricity via [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=solar-concentrator]. In order for this system to work, the [entity=lrf-panel-mk01]s or [entity=stirling-concentrator]s must be directly adjacent to each other, without pipes in between, and they must also be directly adjacent to the [entity=lrf-building-mk01] or [entity=solar-concentrator]. Adding more panels or concentrators will increase the speed at which the salt is warmed, and therefore the speed at which the power plant will be able to operate. The [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] adds 600kW of heat to the molten salt stored inside of it, and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] does the same at 800kW of heat. Note that it can take a while for the salt to warm up initially.\n\nThe reason why the panels need to be placed next to the power plant is that the base game only cares about fluid pressure/speed when simulating fluid flow, and it does not mix fluid temperatures of adjacent entities. If you were to add a pipe between the panels and the power plant, the molten salt in the panel would warm up, but it would never mix with the salt in the pipe, which would therefore never heat up. However, the power plant is able to take molten salt of high enough temperature out of the panels, which drops the pressure in that panel, which lets fluid flow from the other panels to equalise the pressure. This means that the other panels do in fact contribute to the heating of the salt that goes into the power plant, even though it may take a while for the system to reach a steady state.
