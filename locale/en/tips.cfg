    pyalternativeenergy=These are the tips specific to Pyanodon's Alternative Energy. Tips specific to certain techs will appear as you research them.
    blimp=Place down at least two [entity=aerial-base] somewhat far away from each other, and then make an [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01]. You can give the aerial turbine a path between the discharging bases just like you would with trains - select 'store energy' in the menu.\n\nIt will then follow this path. While flying, it will gather wind energy from the air, and when it reaches a base, it will discharge this energy. The bases have a large energy buffer to average out the energy gain over time. You can click on the aerial turbines to see their accumulated energy.
    nuclear-research=Nuclear power is hard. Luckily, a simple nuclear reactor such as the one from the base game ([entity=nuclear-reactor]) that you get from [technology=uranium-processing] is good enough to do research on, so that you may unlock the power of splitting atoms. Yes, it will result in some heat energy, but that energy is hard to use until you gain a deeper understanding of the nuclear physics involved.\n\nOnly when you gain this understanding, at [technology=nuclear-power], will you be able to harness this energy to actually produce electricity for your base using [entity=nuclear-reactor-mk01] and more advanced reactors.
