wind=Wind turbines are a clean and safe way to generate energy for your factory. There are three different varieties of wind turbine. Horizontal axis wind turbines such as [entity=hawt-turbine-mk01], vertical axis wind turbines such as [entity=vawt-turbine-mk01], and multiblade turbines such as [entity=multiblade-turbine-mk01].\n\nAll wind turbines have a variance based on current wind speeds. This number represents the maximum or minimum energy output of the turbine. For example a 10mW turbine with a variance of 80% will have a maximum power output of 18mW and a minimum power output of 2mW. The formula for turbine variance is (sin(2t) + sin(πt)) / 2 where t is the current gametick divided by 10000.\n\nAll wind turbines also have an airspace. Placing a wind turbine within another turbine's airspace will cause interference and is not allowed.\n\nHAWT turbines are manufactured with expensive parts, but benefit more from productivity modules. They have the lowest variance and the highest power output.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 5MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk02] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 25MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 50MW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=hawt-turbine-mk04] → Variance: 50%, Average Output: 80MW, Airspace: 9 tiles.\n\nVAWT turbines are less expensive than HAWT turbines. They have a medium power output and a medium variance.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 4MW, Airspace: 16 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk02] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 20MW, Airspace: 14 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 50MW, Airspace: 14 tiles.\n[entity=vawt-turbine-mk04] → Variance: 70%, Average Output: 85MW, Airspace: 15 tiles.\n\nMultiblade turbines require the fewest materials to manufacture however they have a low power output and a very high variance.\n[entity=multiblade-turbine-mk01] → Variance: 90%, Average Output: 550kW, Airspace: 10 tiles.\n[entity=multiblade-turbine-mk03] → Variance: 80%, Average Output: 34MW, Airspace: 8 tiles.
blimp=Place down at least two [entity=aerial-base] far away from each other, and then make an [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01]. Longer trips allows the turbine to maintain high RPM increasing effectiveness. Give the aerial turbine a path between the discharging bases just like you would with trains - select 'store energy' in the menu.\n\nIt will then follow this path. While flying, it will gather wind energy, and when it reaches a base, it will discharge this energy. The bases have a large energy buffer to average out the energy gain over time. You can click on the aerial turbines to see their accumulated energy and current effectivity. Excess energy discharge is not lost.\n\nEach aerial turbine generates a different amount of energy per tile:\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk01] → 1.8MJ\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk02] → 3.6MJ\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk03] → 6.0MJ\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk04] → 8.0MJ\n- [item=aerial-blimp-ht] → 4.0MJ\n\nEach aerial turbine has a different weight:\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk01] → 60\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk02] → 80\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk03] → 120\n- [item=aerial-blimp-mk04] → 140\n- [item=aerial-blimp-ht] → 40\n\nEnergy(Distance, PerTileMJ, Weight) = Distance * PerTileMJ * F(Distance, Weight)\n\nF(Distance, Weight) = 1 - 1 / (ln(Distance / Weight + 1) + 1)
lfr-stirling=[entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and [entity=stirling-concentrator] both use sunlight to warm up [fluid=molten-salt] during the day. The higher-temperature molten salt can then be used to generate electricity via [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=solar-concentrator]. Adding more panels or concentrators will increase the speed at which the salt is warmed, and therefore the speed at which the power plant will be able to operate. The [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] adds 600kW of heat to the molten salt stored inside of it, and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] does the same at 1.6MW of heat. Note that it can take a while for the salt to warm up initially.\n\nThe temperature of the molten salt does not automatically equalize between entities. Instead you must continuously pump the cold salt into the hot salt. The other panels contribute to the heating of the salt that goes into the power plant, even though it may take a while for the system to reach a steady state.\n\nBoth the [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] are disabled during night time however they will have 100% output even with a small amount of daylight. There is no falloff. The ratio between [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] is 46.2 panels per power plant. The ratio between [entity=stirling-concentrator] and [entity=solar-concentrator] is 34.2 panels per power plant.
microwave-receiver=[entity=microwave-receiver] allows the transfer of solar energy from [item=microwave-satellite] in orbit.\n\nEach [item=microwave-satellite] can beam down up to 4.8MW of energy. In order to get the satellite into orbit, launch it into space with a [entity=rocket-silo]. The [entity=rocket-silo] has room for up to 4 satellites per launch.\n\n[entity=microwave-receiver] can support up to 15 satellites for a total of 72MW.
