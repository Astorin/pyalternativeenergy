    pyalternativeenergy=These are the tips specific to Pyanodon's Alternative Energy. Tips specific to certain techs will appear as you research them.
    blimp=Place down at least two [entity=aerial-base] far away from each other, and then make an [entity=aerial-blimp-mk01]. You can give the aerial turbine a path between the discharging bases just like you would with trains - select 'store energy' in the menu.\n\nIt will then follow this path. While flying, it will gather wind energy from the air, and when it reaches a base, it will discharge this energy. The bases have a large energy buffer to average out the energy gain over time. You can click on the aerial turbines to see their accumulated energy.
    lfr-stirling=[entity=lrf-panel-mk01] and [entity=stirling-concentrator] both use sunlight to warm up [fluid=molten-salt] during the day. The higher-temperature molten salt can then be used to generate electricity via [entity=lrf-building-mk01] and [entity=solar-concentrator]. Adding more panels or concentrators will increase the speed at which the salt is warmed, and therefore the speed at which the power plant will be able to operate. The [entity=lrf-panel-mk01] adds 600kW of heat to the molten salt stored inside of it, and the [entity=stirling-concentrator] does the same at 800kW of heat. Note that it can take a while for the salt to warm up initially.\n\nThe tempature of the molten salt does not automatically equalize between entities. Instead you must continuously pump the cold salt into the hot salt. The other panels contribute to the heating of the salt that goes into the power plant, even though it may take a while for the system to reach a steady state.
