[technology-description]
numal-mk01=Unlock Numals, Hybrid squids with alien DNA influences that lives in abyssal zones. Their metabolism evolved to extract energy from a completely isolated food chain without photosynthesis.
numal-mk02=Unlock better Numals, Hybrid squids with alien DNA influences that lives in abyssal zones. Their metabolism evolved to extract energy from a completely isolated food chain without photosynthesis.
numal-mk03=Unlock improved Numals, Hybrid squids with alien DNA influences that lives in abyssal zones. Their metabolism evolved to extract energy from a completely isolated food chain without photosynthesis.
numal-mk04=Unlock high adapted Numals, Hybrid squids with alien DNA influences that lives in abyssal zones. Their metabolism evolved to extract energy from a completely isolated food chain without photosynthesis.
