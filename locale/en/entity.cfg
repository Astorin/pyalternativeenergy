solar-tower-building=Massive building that needs heliostats to concentrate the solar beans into a point in the top. The more heliostats you put around it, more energy it will generate during the day.
steam-turbine-mk02=Enclosured stream gas turbine.
steam-turbine-mk03=Advanced turbine structure with inovative Nexelit design blades.
steam-turbine-mk04=High-end turbine with boron carbide reinforced blades and magnetic bearings.
mdh=A magnetohydrodynamic converter that utilizes a Brayton cycle to transform thermal energy and kinetic energy directly into electricity.
anti-solar=Nexelit allowed it works at night by thermal difference between Navius and night atmosphere, its all you need to know.
lightning-catcher=Capture and store energy direct from atmosphere redirecting the lightining bolts to special nexelit-antimonium batteries.
solar-concentrator=Building made to concentrate and process the heat from concentrate solar dishes.
stirling-concentrator=More effienct at concentrate solar rays.
