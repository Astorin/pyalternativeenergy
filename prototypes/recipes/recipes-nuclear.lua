--BETA DECAY = lose an electron.

--Alpha decay = creates a atom of helium-4. 2 protons and 2 Neutrons.

--uranium 235 decays to thorium 231 losing 2 Neutrons and 2 protons.

--uranium 238 absorbs a Neutrons becoming u239 which will beta decay to neptunium 239 which will beta decay to plutonium 239
--uranium 238 + 1N = u239 - 1E = n239 - 1E = p239

--fission of uranium yeilds molybendum, Antimony, tin

--tier 1 fission will use the normal uranium chain from pyro. the more enriched versions will last longer and provide more byproducts of fissle material vs fertile material + trash.

--tier 2 fission will require some of the waste product as research material and will allow for plutonium recycling + thorium breeding.

--tier 3 fission will the production of bullshitium via nutron bombardment and then fission of its higher resulting elements.

--tier 4 will allow the bullshitium chain to be put into a closed loop that will begin breeding more bullshitium and open up its waste handling process.

--tier 4 will over lap with the 1st and secound tier of fusion energy and will be required to eventully activate matter + anti matter fusion. plus science shit.
