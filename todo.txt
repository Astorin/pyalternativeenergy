MOD IN GENERAL

 - Make all the pending recipes
       - add flourite/Hydrofluoric acid
 - Check for deadlocks
 - Investigate if its possible to use the same resource for two differents outputs (coalbed gas and kerogen).
        - sort of. items only. you can have a item and a fluid as results. a drill can remove the item without the fluid but you cant get the fluid without the solid and that cant be gotten out at all and it jams. only way for a drill to have multiple results is for them to be items. - KING
        - Then i believe we will need a new resource to allow coalbed gas and kerogen to be extracted as a finite resource. - py
 - Check why the working animations on Numals just doesnt appears.
 - Change the turbines to work with steam in different temps and efficiency
 - All burning based, nuclear and solar powerplants shall contain a cooling cycle and generation of molten salt for further use (as heat source/steam)
 - The consumption of metals/minerals shall increase in the later recipes since the ore chains tends to be very productive in later stages.

GRAPHICS (feel free to insert any requierements here):

- Make Cottonguts powerplant (DUNNO, maybe not)
- Make Phaddai powerplant (DUNNO, maybe not)
- Redo coalbed gas (maybe make it as a resource in map like oil sands or antimony, to restrict the area to extract it). POSTPONED

CODING:

- Solar panels MK02 to MK04 to change rotation during day (simulate sun tracking)
- Make all the thermo solar buildings working as intended
- Make the aerials move around and back to base to "deposit" energy in the grid
- Make tidal powerplant and Numal farm works on shore : DONE

FYI:

- there is no more "dirty-water". there is dirty-water-light (mud) and dirty-water-heavy(normal tailings)
- mukmoux lard is called mukmoux-fat

KING TODO:

 - setup molten salt loops on all the power plants
      - coal
      - gas
      - oil
      - biomass
            - mk1 done
      - nuclear
      - thermal solar
      - solar updraft tower
      - solar concentrator
      - mdh at 3000 degrees
 - convert all non electric buildings to heat based energy source
 - setup energy converter building with 4 variants
      - electric
      - molten salt heat transfer
      - liquid burner
      - solid burner
            - reuse boiler/ heat exchanger entities for this unless py makes something

 - coal + coal like items to its own fuel category

remove space science pack from atom bomb tech.
replace fuel rod in atom bomb with plutonium "metal"
