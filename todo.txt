MOD IN GENERAL

 - Make all the pending recipes
 - Write the rest of tech tree
 - Check for deadlocks
 - Investigate if its possible to use the same resource for two differents outputs (coalbed gas and kerogen).
 - Investigate if its possible to put a sattelice in space to send microwaves to the ground receptor.
 - Check why the working animations on Numals just doesnt appears.
 - Change the turbines to work with steam in different temps and efficiency
 - Move py-turbine from fusion energy to pyAE steam turbine mk01
 - All burning based, nuclear and solar powerplants shall contain a cooling cycle and generation of molten salt for further use (as heat source/steam)

GRAPHICS (feel free to insert any requierements here):

- Make biomass powerplant
- Make Coal powerplant
- Make Oil powerplant
- Make Gas powerplant
- Make Cottonguts powerplant
- Make Phaddai powerplant
- Make microwave receiver
- Redo coalbed gas (maybe make it as a resource in map like oil sands or antimony, to restrict the area to extract it).

CODING:

- Solar panels MK02 to MK04 to change rotation during day (simulate sun tracking)
- Make all the thermo solar buildings working as intended
- Make the aerials move around and back to base to "deposit" energy in the grid
- Make tidal powerplant and Numal farm works on shore
